//! GDS Macros - Proc-macro implementations for the Projection System
//!
//! This crate contains the proc-macro implementations that generate
//! Triadic-Pentadic structures (Empirical Forms) for the Projection System
//! in the Kernel (GDS crate). The Projection System is the Pure Form Processor
//! that generates forms through the Container-Contained Organic Unity.
