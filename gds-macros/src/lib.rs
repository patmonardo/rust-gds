//! GDS Macros - Proc-macro implementations for the Projection System
//!
//! This crate contains the proc-macro implementations that generate
//! Triadic-Pentadic structures (Empirical Forms) for the Projection System.
//! The focus is on the ProjectionFactory, Eval/Form system, and the
//! Container-Contained Organic Unity.
