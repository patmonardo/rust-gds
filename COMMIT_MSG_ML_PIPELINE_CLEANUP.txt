feat(codegen): Resolve PipelineDescriptor collision - ML Pipeline consolidation

PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================
After TP-007 Phase 2 reorganization, discovered critical naming collision:
- Two PipelineDescriptor types (general + ML-specific)
- eval/ml/ code using deleted flat import paths
- Tests only running with --lib (missed ML feature code)

ARCHITECTURAL DECISION
======================
"Only ML Pipelines exist" - User directive

Rationale: FormDB is an ML Knowledge Apps platform. The "general" pipeline
was an unused abstraction. ML PipelineDescriptor IS the pipeline.

CHANGES
=======

1. Deleted General Pipeline
   - Removed: src/projection/codegen/descriptors/pipeline.rs (267 lines)
   - Removed redundant abstraction

2. Module Re-exports Unified
   - descriptors/mod.rs: Export ml::PipelineDescriptor as THE pipeline
   - descriptors/ml/mod.rs: Removed alias, PipelineDescriptor owns name
   - codegen/mod.rs: Updated re-exports with clarifying comments

3. Import Path Migrations (90+ files)
   Fixed eval/ml/ directory to use new structured paths:
   - codegen::ml::pipeline_descriptor → codegen::descriptors::ml::pipeline
   - codegen::ml::step_descriptor → codegen::descriptors::ml::step
   - codegen::computation_descriptor → codegen::descriptors::computation
   - codegen::ml::{ModelType, ModelCandidate} → codegen::descriptors::ml::*

4. Test Infrastructure
   - Added PipelineDescriptor::test_pipeline() helper for unit tests
   - Updated runtime/computation.rs tests (2 tests)
   - Updated runtime/storage.rs tests (2 tests)
   - Fixed test imports in brahmachakra_integration.rs
   - Fixed test imports in ml/pipeline_descriptor_test.rs

5. Additional Fixes
   - eval_macro.rs: Fixed property_descriptor import path
   - orientation.rs: Added serde derives for --all-features support
   - All ML model code: Fixed ModelType/ModelCandidate imports

VERIFICATION
============
✅ cargo build --all-features  → SUCCESS
✅ cargo test --all-features   → 2,074 tests passed (1970 lib + 104 integration)
✅ No naming collisions remain
✅ All import paths consistent

FILES CHANGED
=============
Deleted: 1 file (descriptors/pipeline.rs)
Modified: 9 core files (module exports, runtime tests, macros)
Batch updated: 90+ files in eval/ml/ (import path migrations)

IMPACT
======
- Single source of truth: ML PipelineDescriptor
- Clear namespace: codegen::descriptors::* hierarchy
- Runtime agnostic: computation/storage contexts work with ML Pipeline
- No functionality lost (general pipeline was unused)

KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
================================
This commit focuses on ML Pipeline consolidation (the complex refactor).

REMAINING WORK (TP-008 - Procedure Architecture):
- Procedure module placement needs review (descriptors/procedure/?)
- AlgorithmDescriptor design incomplete
- Algorithm trait needs proper runtime contract
- Registry pattern not yet implemented
- Form System integration pending

The ML work was the hard, messy untangling. Procedure improvements will be
cleaner architectural work.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
See doc/TP-007_OPTION_A_COMPLETE.md for detailed technical documentation.

Breaking Changes: None (internal refactoring only)
Migration Guide: N/A (library internals)
