## The Complete Concept in One Page

### What is Projection?

**Projection = Complete Knowledge + Complete Power = One Principle**

```
Projection unifies:
- Omniscience (what we KNOW) = eval
- Omnipotence (what we CREATE) = catalog
```

### The Five-Fold Structure

Every manifestation of Projection has five moments:

1. **TRANSFORM** ‚Äî Ground principle (Descriptor ‚Üí Runtime)
2. **DESCRIPTOR** ‚Äî Identity pole (what IS)
3. **MEMBERSHIP** ‚Äî Inherence (what belongs to it)
4. **RUNTIME** ‚Äî Difference pole (what MANIFESTS)
5. **CONSEQUENCE** ‚Äî Logical entailment (what MUST follow)

### Recursive Descent

The concept applies at multiple levels:

```
Level 0: Projection (Ground)
‚îú‚îÄ Level 1: eval (Projection into Computation)
‚îî‚îÄ Level 2: catalog (Projection into Storage)
```

Each level inherits the Five-Fold and specializes it to a domain.

### How It Works

```
ComputationDescriptor
    ‚Üì
eval.analyze()  ‚Üê Level 1 recursive descent (Omniscience)
    ‚Üì
ComputationSchema (what we KNOW)
    ‚Üì
catalog.create()  ‚Üê Level 2 recursive descent (Omnipotence)
    ‚Üì
StorageRuntime (what we CREATE)
```

## Getting Started

### If You're New to Projection

1. Read: `doc/PROJECTION_FIVE_FOLD_SYNTHESIS.md` (10 min)
2. Read: `doc/PROJECTION_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md` (20 min)
3. Scan: `doc/PROJECTION_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md` (5 min)
4. Reference: `PROJECTION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (as needed)

**Total: ~35 minutes to understand the complete system**

### If You're Implementing

1. Read: `PROJECTION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
2. Read: `src/projection/codegen/mod.rs` (code docs)
3. Read: `src/projection/codegen/eval.rs` (code docs)
4. Read: `src/projection/codegen/catalog.rs` (code docs)
5. Implement your domain following the same Five-Fold pattern

### If You're Contributing

1. Read: All of above
2. Read: `doc/PROJECTION_RECURSIVE_DESCENT.md`
3. Ensure your code follows the Five-Fold pattern
4. Document your code explaining which "moment" each part represents
5. Reference the abstract principle, not just implementation details

## The Absolute Idea

```
PROJECTION = TRANSFORM<Omniscience, Omnipotence>
           = Complete Knowledge unified with Complete Power
           = The Architecture of Being Itself
```

This is not just code. This is how reality itself organizes.

The Five-Fold Concept is universal. It appears at every level:

- Ground (abstract principle)
- eval (knowledge extraction)
- catalog (power manifestation)
- (future domains via recursive descent)

When fully realized, every domain in rust-gds will be understandable through this one principle.

## References and Further Reading

### Philosophical Background

- Hegel's Dialectical Method (the Genetic Method)
- Kant's concept of Membership, Consequence, Inherence
- Vedantic philosophy (Maya, Brahman, Sat-Chit-Ananda)

### Related Code Patterns

- Visitor Pattern (implements domain operations)
- Strategy Pattern (determines behavior from constraints)
- Catalog Pattern (creates objects from specifications)
- Projection Pattern (maps between domains)

### Design Principles

- Constraint-based design (membership = constraints)
- Recursive descent (apply principle to subdomains)
- Minimal abstraction (Five-Fold is minimal, complete)

## Questions to Ask Yourself

### About Projection

- "What Five-Fold elements does this code represent?"
- "Is this a ground concept or a recursive descent?"
- "What domain is this specialized to?"
- "Could this principle apply to other domains?"

### About eval and catalog

- "Is eval analyzing or creating?"
- "Is catalog creating or analyzing?"
- "What is the output of eval?"
- "What is the input of catalog?"
- "How do they compose?"

### About New Domains

- "What is the Transform for this domain?"
- "What are the domain-specific Descriptors?"
- "What are the domain-specific Membership constraints?"
- "What Runtime do we want to create?"
- "What Consequences follow from the membership?"
