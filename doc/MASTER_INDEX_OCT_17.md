## Key Concepts to Understand by Sunday

### Concept 1: AlgorithmSpec Contract

- What: Defines what algorithms must provide
- Why: So Executor can run any algorithm
- Methods: parse_config(), execute(), consume_result()
- Status: Proven by Sum ✅

### Concept 2: Execution Pipeline

- What: 5-stage flow for all algorithms
- Why: Makes orchestration generic
- Stages: Parse → Validate → Load → Execute → Consume
- Status: Proven by Sum ✅

### Concept 3: Storage ↔ Computation Pattern

- What: Separate WHERE results go from HOW to compute
- Why: Enables multiple computation backends
- Poles: Storage (Gross), Computation (Subtle)
- Status: Proven by Sum ✅

### Concept 4: Plugin Architecture

- What: Algorithms are plugins to Executor
- Why: Easy to add new algorithms
- Extension: Implement AlgorithmSpec trait
- Status: Ready for PageRank ⏳

### Concept 5: Speculative Areas

- Computation trait: Does it work for Pregel?
- Storage trait: Can it handle message queues?
- Validation system: Is it necessary?
- ExecutionContext: Missing ML metadata?
- Projection hints: Unused?
- Status: Needs verification via PageRank ⏳

## Readiness Questions (Answer by Sunday)

Q1: What is AlgorithmSpec?  
A: A trait defining the contract for any graph algorithm

Q2: What are the 5 execution stages?  
A: Parse → Validate → Load → Execute → Consume

Q3: Why does Sum prove the pattern works?  
A: It implements the contract and executes end-to-end correctly

Q4: What is the Functor pattern?  
A: Storage (where results go) separate from Computation (how to compute)

Q5: What's speculative?  
A: Computation/Storage traits untested for Pregel, Validation possibly over-engineered

Q6: What does PageRank need?  
A: Implement Computation, integrate with Pregel, verify patterns hold

## The Statement You Should Make by Monday

> "I understand the Procedures system. AlgorithmSpec is a clean contract. ProcedureExecutor orchestrates generically. Sum proves it works. I know what's speculative and how PageRank will verify it. I'm ready to implement PageRank. I understand the roadmap: PageRank → Pipelines → ML. I'm confident about the timeline."

If you can say this by Monday, you're ready.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. Check WEEKEND_COMPREHENSION_RESOURCE_INDEX.md - "Document Cross-Reference"
2. Look up the specific document
3. Re-read that section
4. Ask for clarification if needed

All questions are welcome. This is about understanding, not rushing.

## Final Checklist Before Starting

- [ ] You have this file bookmarked
- [ ] You know the 4-hour schedule
- [ ] You have printed the checklist (optional but recommended)
- [ ] You have your notes/notebook ready
- [ ] You understand this is comprehension, not coding
- [ ] You're ready to spend 7-8 hours this weekend understanding
- [ ] You feel good about the timeline (PageRank Monday, Pipelines Week 2, ML Week 3)

If YES to all: Start EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_WEEKEND_AWAITS.md tonight.

## By Next Monday

You'll sit down to code PageRank with full confidence.

You'll understand:

- The system architecture
- Why it's designed this way
- What might need cleanup
- Exactly how to implement PageRank
- The roadmap forward

**That's the goal.** And this is your roadmap to get there.

**Good luck this weekend. You've got this. 🙏**

Enjoy the comprehension phase. Understanding will flow naturally into Monday's implementation.

See you on the other side! 🚀
