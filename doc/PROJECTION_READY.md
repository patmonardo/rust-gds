# 🎯 Projection Implementation - Ready to Build!

## Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### What We Have

#### ✅ Rust Traits (Complete)
```
src/projection/traits/
├── abstract_projections.rs ✅
│   ├── AbstractProjections<I, P>
│   ├── Projections<I, P>
│   └── ProjectionsBuilder<I, P>
├── element_projection.rs ✅
│   ├── ElementProjection
│   ├── PropertyMappings
│   └── PropertyMappingsBuilder
└── property_mapping.rs ✅
    ├── PropertyMapping
    ├── PropertyMappingBuilder
    └── Aggregation
```

#### ✅ TypeScript Reference (Complete)
```
ts-gds/projection/primitive/
├── NodeProjection.ts ✅
├── NodeProjections.ts ✅
├── RelationshipProjection.ts ✅
├── RelationshipProjections.ts ✅
└── PropertyMappings.ts ✅
```

#### ⚠️  Rust Implementations (MISSING)
```
src/projection/impls/
├── mod.rs (commented out)
├── node_projection.rs ❌ NEEDS
├── relationship_projection.rs ❌ NEEDS
└── property_mappings.rs ❌ NEEDS (maybe - check if trait is enough)
```

### What We Need to Build

#### 1. NodeProjection

**Purpose**: Configure how nodes are projected into graph
**Fields**:
- `label: NodeLabel` - The node label
- `properties: PropertyMappings` - Property configurations

**Methods**:
- Constructor, builder pattern
- Property access
- Validation

#### 2. RelationshipProjection

**Purpose**: Configure how relationships are projected
**Fields**:
- `type: RelationshipType` - The relationship type
- `orientation: Orientation` - NATURAL, REVERSE, UNDIRECTED
- `aggregation: Aggregation` - NONE, MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT
- `properties: PropertyMappings` - Property configurations
- `index_inverse: bool` - Whether to build inverse index

**Methods**:
- Constructor, builder pattern
- Property access
- Validation

#### 3. Concrete Projection Collections

**NodeProjections**: `Projections<NodeLabel, NodeProjection>`
**RelationshipProjections**: `Projections<RelationshipType, RelationshipProjection>`

These might just be type aliases since the generic `Projections<I, P>` already exists!

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Structs (30 min)
```rust
// src/projection/impls/node_projection.rs
pub struct NodeProjection {
    label: NodeLabel,
    properties: PropertyMappings,
}

// src/projection/impls/relationship_projection.rs
pub struct RelationshipProjection {
    rel_type: RelationshipType,
    orientation: Orientation,
    aggregation: Aggregation,
    properties: PropertyMappings,
    index_inverse: bool,
}
```

#### Phase 2: Builders (30 min)
```rust
pub struct NodeProjectionBuilder { ... }
pub struct RelationshipProjectionBuilder { ... }
```

#### Phase 3: Trait Implementations (30 min)
Implement `ElementProjection` for both

#### Phase 4: Type Aliases (5 min)
```rust
pub type NodeProjections = Projections<NodeLabel, NodeProjection>;
pub type RelationshipProjections = Projections<RelationshipType, RelationshipProjection>;
```

#### Phase 5: Tests (30 min)
Basic construction, builder, property access tests

**Total Estimated Time**: ~2 hours

### Supporting Types Needed

Check if these exist, if not, add them:

1. **Orientation** enum
   ```rust
   pub enum Orientation {
       Natural,
       Reverse,
       Undirected,
   }
   ```

2. **Aggregation** enum (might be in property_mapping.rs already)
   ```rust
   pub enum Aggregation {
       None,
       Min,
       Max,
       Sum,
       Count,
       Single,
   }
   ```

### Dependencies

All should be in place:
- ✅ NodeLabel (exists in projection/)
- ✅ RelationshipType (exists in projection/)
- ✅ PropertyMappings (trait exists)
- ✅ Aggregation (check property_mapping.rs)
- ⚠️  Orientation (might need to add)

### Next Actions

1. **Review property_mapping.rs** - Check if Aggregation and Orientation are there
2. **Create node_projection.rs** - Implement NodeProjection
3. **Create relationship_projection.rs** - Implement RelationshipProjection
4. **Update impls/mod.rs** - Export the new types
5. **Add tests** - Verify functionality
6. **Update projection/mod.rs** - Export at module level

### Why This Matters

Projections are the **configuration layer** for graph construction:

```
Schema (what properties exist)
    ↓
Projection (how to load/aggregate them)
    ↓
Graph (the loaded data structure)
    ↓
Algorithm (compute on it)
```

Without projections, we can't:
- Configure property aggregation (SUM, MAX, etc.)
- Handle parallel relationships properly
- Configure relationship orientation
- Filter which properties to load

**This is blocking graph construction patterns!**

## Ready to Build? 🚀

Say the word and I'll:
1. Check what types exist
2. Generate the implementations
3. Wire them up
4. Test them
5. Document them

**Estimated completion: 2 hours of focused work**

Let's do this! 🎯
