## Patterns Established

### 1. Composition Over Inheritance ‚úÖ

**Java**: `class Sigmoid extends SingleParentVariable<Matrix>`  
**Rust**: `struct Sigmoid { base: VariableBase }`

**Why It Works**:

- VariableBase holds parents, dimensions, gradient tracking
- Functions delegate to base, implement only their logic
- No inheritance hierarchy, just composition + delegation

### 2. Interior Mutability for Caching ‚úÖ

**Problem**: `forward()` needs mutation but trait uses `&self`  
**Solution**: `RefCell<HashMap<*const dyn Any, Box<dyn Tensor>>>`

**Pattern**:

```rust
fn apply(&self, ctx: &ComputationContext) -> Box<dyn Tensor> {
    // ctx has RefCell internally for caching
    ctx.data(self.parent())  // Borrows mutably inside
}
```

### 3. Enum Dispatch vs instanceof ‚úÖ

**Java**: `if (x instanceof Scalar) { ((Scalar) x).extract() }`  
**Rust**: `match x { Scalar(e) => e.extract(), Array(e) => ... }`

**Benefits**: Compile-time exhaustiveness, no runtime casting, better performance

### 4. Dialectical Strategy Selection ‚úÖ

**Thesis**: Retry-based sampling (sparse spaces)  
**Antithesis**: Exclusion-based sampling (dense spaces)  
**Synthesis**: Adaptive dispatcher based on sampling ratio

### 5. Foundation-First Translation ‚úÖ

**Order**:

1. Data structures (LocalIdMap, Tensor types)
2. Interfaces (BatchNeighbors, Variable traits)
3. Basic implementations (SubGraph, Constant)
4. Complex algorithms (builder methods - next phase)

**Benefit**: Continuous validation, incremental complexity

### 6. Trait-Based Abstractions ‚úÖ

**Java**: `@FunctionalInterface` with lambdas  
**Rust**: Traits with struct implementations

**Examples**:

- NeighborhoodFunction - neighborhood sampling
- RelationshipWeights - edge weight lookup
- BatchNeighbors - batch data access

### 7. Trait Objects for Polymorphism ‚úÖ

**When to use**:

- `&dyn Trait` - borrowed polymorphism
- `Box<dyn Trait>` - owned polymorphism
- Generic `<T: Trait>` - monomorphic (compile-time)

**Pattern**: Use trait objects when runtime polymorphism matches Java's design

## What's Ready to Use

### ‚úÖ Ready Now

1. **Tensor Operations**

   - Matrix, Vector, Scalar
   - Element-wise operations
   - Aggregations (sum, mean, max)

2. **Variable System**

   - Forward propagation
   - Backward propagation (gradient computation)
   - 19 function types (Sigmoid, Relu, Softmax, etc.)

3. **Computation Context**

   - Caching for forward pass
   - Gradient accumulation for backward pass
   - Memory management

4. **Batch Processing**

   - BatchQueue with lazy iteration
   - RangeBatch, ListBatch, MappedBatch
   - Parallel batch consumption (foundation)

5. **Sampling**

   - UniformSampler
   - WeightedUniformSampler
   - Long samplers with adaptive strategies

6. **Feature Extraction**

   - ScalarFeatureExtractor
   - ArrayFeatureExtractor
   - Enum-based dispatch

7. **Subgraph Foundation**

   - LocalIdMap (ID mapping)
   - BatchNeighbors trait
   - SubGraph (basic structure)

8. **Abstractions**
   - NeighborhoodFunction
   - RelationshipWeights
   - TrainingMethod enum

### ‚è≥ Needs Graph API Integration

1. **SubGraph Builder Methods**

   - `buildSubGraph()` - single layer
   - `buildSubGraphs()` - multi-layer GNN
   - Requires: Graph types, NeighborhoodFunction implementation

2. **NeighborhoodSampler Implementation**

   - Currently stub
   - Needs: Graph API, relationship streaming
   - Uses: UniformSampler, WeightedUniformSampler (ready!)

3. **Relationship Weight Lookup**
   - SubGraph stores weights currently
   - Needs: Graph API integration
   - Uses: RelationshipWeights trait (ready!)

## What We Learned

### Translation Principles

1. **Survey before translating** - Find existing types (RangeBatch, ListBatch)
2. **Match Java structure** - Use batch index, not separate tracking
3. **Preserve performance** - Lazy iteration, no unnecessary allocation
4. **Use blanket implementations** - Rust's trait system is powerful
5. **Foundation first** - Data structures ‚Üí interfaces ‚Üí implementations ‚Üí algorithms
6. **Fix inconsistencies immediately** - Don't let tech debt accumulate
7. **Document patterns** - ADRs, doc comments, summaries

### Common Pitfalls (and How We Avoided Them)

‚ùå **DON'T**: Store parents as separate fields  
‚úÖ **DO**: Use VariableBase with `Vec<Box<dyn Variable>>`

‚ùå **DON'T**: Materialize iterators prematurely  
‚úÖ **DO**: Use lazy RangeBatch with trait objects

‚ùå **DON'T**: Use fully-qualified paths in function bodies  
‚úÖ **DO**: Add module-level imports

‚ùå **DON'T**: Drop trait/struct implementations when refactoring  
‚úÖ **DO**: Check existing code, preserve required implementations

‚ùå **DON'T**: Create inconsistent one-off solutions  
‚úÖ **DO**: Follow established patterns (VariableBase composition)

### Rust Idioms We Mastered

- **Composition + Delegation** (vs inheritance)
- **Interior Mutability** (RefCell for caching)
- **Trait Objects** (for runtime polymorphism)
- **Enum Dispatch** (for closed type hierarchies)
- **Blanket Implementations** (trait X for all T: Y)
- **Associated Types** (trait-level generics)
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions** (monomorphization when possible)

## The Road Ahead

2. Review RandomGraph usage
3. Implement NeighborhoodFunction for Graph
4. Implement RelationshipWeights for Graph
5. Complete SubGraph builder methods

### Phase 2: Pipeline System (Big One)

**Goal**: End-to-end ML pipelines

**Known**:

- Java has Pipeline abstraction
- We have DecisionTree ready
- Two special pipelines not yet reviewed
- Our pipeline may differ from Java's

1. What does Java Pipeline have that we lack?
2. Is our current approach worth pursuing?
3. Can we simplify for our use cases?
4. How do ML-Core + DecisionTree integrate?

**Approach**:

1. Survey Java Pipeline system
2. Identify essential vs optional components
3. Design Rust-idiomatic pipeline
4. Implement incrementally with tests

1. Dialectical architecture (Being/NonBeing/Synthesis)
2. Composition patterns
3. Interior mutability patterns
4. Enum dispatch patterns
5. Foundation-first translation methodology
6. Kernel‚ÜîUserLand integration path

### Phase 4: Performance & Optimization

**Goal**: Profile and optimize hot paths
