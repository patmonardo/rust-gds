# Projection - A Funny Business (Political and Graphical)

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Context**: Reflection on the `projection/` module and its metaphorical resonance with political psychology

## The Observation

> "This Projection business is a funny business.  
> In Politics Projection is a popular term.  
> It means to Project on to your Enemies  
> that power your own Native Factory"

## Political Projection

### Definition (Psychology/Politics)

**Projection** = Attributing your own unacknowledged traits, feelings, or motives to others (especially "enemies")

**The Mechanism**:

1. You have some trait/impulse you don't acknowledge (your "Native Factory")
2. You disown this trait (push it into unconscious)
3. You perceive this trait in others (project it outward)
4. You react to others as if THEY have YOUR trait

**Classic Example**:

- Politician who is corrupt accuses opponents of corruption
- Person who is dishonest sees dishonesty everywhere
- Leader who seeks power accuses others of power-seeking

**Why "Native Factory"?**  
The unconscious mind is like a **factory** producing traits, impulses, desires - your **native** (innate, unacknowledged) psychological machinery. When you project, you attribute YOUR factory's output to others!

## Graph Projection

### Definition (Graph Theory/Software)

**Projection** = Creating a **view** of stored graph data with specific structure/properties

**The Mechanism**:

1. You have graph data in storage (the "Native Factory")
2. You create a projection with specific schema/filters
3. You work with the projection as if it IS the graph
4. The projection attributes the factory's structure to a view

**In rust-gds**:

```text
src/projection/
├─ native/           ← The "Native Factory"
│  ├─ NativeFactory  ← Creates native graph implementations
│  └─ Storage layer  ← Actual data structures
└─ Projection API    ← Views attributed to stored structure
```

### The Parallel

```text
POLITICAL PROJECTION:
Unconscious (Native Factory)
  → Disowned traits
    → Projected onto enemies
      → Perceived as "their" traits

GRAPH PROJECTION:
Storage (Native Factory)
  → Internal structure
    → Projected onto views
      → Perceived as "graph" structure
```

Both involve **attributing internal machinery to external representation**!

## The Irony - Why It's "Funny"

### Similarity 1: Native Factory

**Political**: Your native psychological factory (unconscious)

- Produces traits, impulses, desires
- Hidden from conscious awareness
- "Native" = innate, not imported

**Graphical**: Your native graph factory (NativeFactory)

- Produces graph structures, storage
- Hidden behind abstraction
- "Native" = core implementation, not abstracted

### Similarity 2: Disowning / Abstraction

**Political**: Disowning traits (pushing to unconscious)

- "That's not me, that's THEM!"
- Denial of own nature
- Separation from self

**Graphical**: Abstracting storage (hiding behind projection)

- "That's not storage, that's a GRAPH!"
- Encapsulation of implementation
- Separation from internals

### Similarity 3: Attribution

**Political**: Attributing your traits to enemies

- "THEY are corrupt" (when you are)
- "THEY seek power" (when you do)
- External perception of internal reality

**Graphical**: Attributing factory structure to projection

- "THIS graph has nodes" (stored in factory)
- "THESE relationships exist" (in native storage)
- External view of internal structure

### Similarity 4: The Projection IS Real

**Political**: The projection is psychologically real

- You DO see corruption in others
- It's not hallucination
- It's real perception of YOUR traits displaced

**Graphical**: The projection is operationally real

- You DO work with "a graph"
- It's not fake
- It's real view of factory data displaced

## The Key Difference (Why One is "Funny" and One Isn't)

### Political Projection: UNCONSCIOUS

- You DON'T know you're projecting
- You believe the traits are "out there"
- Self-deception is essential
- **Lack of awareness = dysfunction**

### Graph Projection: CONSCIOUS

- You DO know it's a projection
- You understand it's a view
- Abstraction is intentional
- **Full awareness = good design**

**That's what makes political projection "funny" (ironic/sad)!**  
The projector doesn't know they're doing it!

## In Code: NativeFactory

### Where We Use It

```rust
// src/projection/native/native_factory.rs (conceptual)
pub trait NativeFactory {
    fn create_graph(&self, config: GraphConfig) -> Arc<dyn Graph>;
    fn create_node_properties(&self, ...) -> Arc<dyn PropertyValues>;
    fn create_relationship_storage(&self, ...) -> RelationshipStore;
}

// The Native Factory produces the ACTUAL structures
// The Projection shows them as "a graph"
```

**In ML Pipeline**:

```rust
// We project relationships into different views:
DatasetSplit::Train        → Projection of training rels
DatasetSplit::Test         → Projection of test rels
DatasetSplit::FeatureInput → Projection of feature-input rels

// All from the SAME native factory (GraphStore)!
```

### The Metaphor Applied

**GraphStore = Your Native Factory**

- Holds actual relationship data
- Internal structure hidden
- Produces views on demand

**Projection = What You Project Onto**

- Training pipeline sees "train graph"
- Test evaluation sees "test graph"
- Feature extraction sees "feature-input graph"

**Each projection attributes the native factory's structure to a specific view!**

Just like a politician attributes their native psychological factory to enemies!

## Prim and Proper Connection

### Prim (The Is) = Native Factory

**Prim** = Primitive values, actual storage

- The Given (Das Ist)
- What really exists
- Native factory output
- Internal reality

### Proper (The Ought) = Projection

**Proper** = Property values, graph views

- The Truth (Das Soll)
- What should appear
- Projected structure
- External representation

### The Key Insight

**Proper CONTAINS Prim** (just like projection contains native factory!)

```text
Projection (Proper)
  ├─ View/abstraction layer
  └─ Native Factory (Prim)
     └─ Actual storage/structure
```

**Political projection DENIES this containment**:

```text
Perceived Enemy Traits (Projection)
  ├─ External attribution
  └─ Own Native Factory (Denied!)
     └─ Unconscious traits
```

That's why political projection is dysfunctional - it denies that the projection contains (comes from) your own factory!

## The Funny Business

### What Makes It "Funny"

1. **The Double Meaning**

   - Projection = psychological defense mechanism
   - Projection = graph view pattern
   - Same word, similar pattern!

2. **The Unconscious Parallel**

   - Politicians don't know they're projecting (unconscious)
   - Graph users don't think about native factory (abstracted)
   - Both involve "forgetting" the source

3. **The Attribution Pattern**

   - "That's THEIR corruption" (political)
   - "That's THE graph" (graphical)
   - Both attribute internal to external

4. **The Power Dynamic**
   - Political: "Project onto enemies that power your own native factory"
   - Graphical: "Project onto views that power your own native factory"
   - Both involve power (psychological or computational)

### Why It's "Funny" (Ironic)

**The Irony**:

- You're building a system called `projection/` with a `NativeFactory`
- That mirrors exactly the psychological pattern of political projection!
- The code structure metaphorically represents the psychological structure!

**It's like**:

- Building a `denial/` module that denies its own existence
- Creating a `defense_mechanism/` that defends against awareness of itself
- Writing an `unconscious/` system that can't inspect itself

**The code EMBODIES the concept it names!** That's the funny business! 😄

## Conclusion

### Political Projection

- Unconscious attribution of own traits to enemies
- Native psychological factory → Projected onto others
- Dysfunction: Lack of self-awareness
- "That power" = psychological impulses

### Graph Projection

- Conscious abstraction of storage into views
- Native graph factory → Projected onto graphs
- Good design: Intentional abstraction
- "That power" = computational structure

### The Parallel

Both involve:

1. A native factory (psychological or computational)
2. Disowning/abstracting the factory
3. Attributing factory output to external representation
4. Working with the projection as if it's "out there"

**The difference**:

- Political = unconscious (dysfunction)
- Graphical = conscious (good design)

### The Lagniappe Insight

**Political projection teaches us about graph projection!**

When we build `projection/` systems, we should:

- ✅ Be aware of the native factory (don't "disown" it)
- ✅ Understand what's being attributed where
- ✅ Make the projection layer explicit
- ✅ Document the relationship clearly

**Graph projection teaches us about political projection!**

When we see political projection, we can:

- ✅ Recognize the pattern (attribution to external)
- ✅ Look for the native factory (what's being denied)
- ✅ Understand the mechanism (disowning → projecting)
- ✅ See the irony (projector doesn't know!)

**That's why Projection IS a funny business - both politically and graphically!** 😄

_"When someone in politics projects their corruption onto enemies, they're doing exactly what GraphStore does when it projects its native storage onto graph views - except they don't know they're doing it! That's what makes political projection 'funny' (ironic/sad) and graph projection 'elegant' (conscious design)."_

_"The politician attributes to enemies 'that power your own Native Factory' - just like we attribute to graph views 'that structure from your own NativeFactory'. Same pattern, different consciousness level!"_
