## ‚ùì Uncertainties & Inadequacies (observed Oct 5, 2025)

The following items were observed while reviewing the code and examples this morning. They represent open questions, potential design gaps, or areas that would benefit from clarification and follow-up work.

- Trait surface complexity: there are many small traits (GraphStore, Graph, IdMap, RelationshipPredicate, RelationshipIterator, RelationshipProperties, etc.). It's not always obvious which trait is the "owner" of a responsibility. This increases cognitive load for new contributors.
- Builder ergonomics and trait visibility: builder methods require explicit trait imports (e.g. `RelationshipPropertyStoreBuilder`). This leaks implementation details into caller code and may be surprising.
- Property selection semantics: `build_selected_relationship_properties` auto-selects a property when only one exists, but behavior when multiple properties are present is ambiguous. There is no explicit override policy documented (priority, selector semantics, errors vs fallback).
- Property value type model: `SelectedRelationshipProperty.value_at_or` calls `double_value` and `PropertyValue` appears numeric, suggesting limited generic support for other value types (integers, strings, enums). The mapping between `ValueType` and `PropertyValue` semantics needs clarification.
- Relationship property model is double-centric: many traversal and cursor APIs assume numeric property values; the system may not uniformly support heterogeneous value types across all code paths.
- Concurrency model and Arc::make_mut uses: `DefaultGraph` and `DefaultGraphStore` use `Arc` and `Arc::make_mut`. The exact thread-safety and mutation rules (what operations are allowed concurrently; copy-on-write semantics) need an explicit contract.
- Relationship property snapshots vs live views: `Graph::relationship_type_filtered_graph` clones stores and topologies. It's not obvious whether these are shallow copies (sharing underlying data) or deep snapshots. Clarify expectations for mutability and lifetime.
- Inverse-indexing fallbacks: some degree/inverse-degree functions return `None` when inverse indices are absent. The expected behavior for APIs that depend on inverse indices should be documented more thoroughly.
- Cursor coverage: only `RelationshipCursor` (and modifiable variant) are present. There's no `NodeCursor` equivalent; consider whether a NodeCursor is needed for symmetry and future features.
- Error coverage: `GraphStoreError` usage is present but it's unclear whether all failure modes are represented (e.g., invalid selectors, type mismatches when requesting property values, builder misuse).
- Missing MSRV and platform guarantees: Minimum Rust Version (MSRV) is not documented and platform support (macOS/Windows) is not explicit.
- CI and quality gates: clippy and rustfmt are not enforced in CI. Also integration tests are still planned but not implemented.
- Performance unknowns at scale: topology offsets and precomputed vectors look fine for medium graphs but should be benchmarked for very large graphs (memory and traversal throughput).

These observations are not all blockers, but they should be discussed and triaged before we start CoreGraphStore work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Actions (short-term prioritized)

1. ADR: Property selection and fallback semantics

- Document how a property is chosen for traversal and what selectors mean.
- Define explicit behavior when multiple properties exist (prefer explicit selector; otherwise error or deterministic selection).

2. ADR: Property value typing

- Clarify `ValueType` vs `PropertyValue` (currently appears numeric-centric).
- Decide whether to support fully dynamic typed property values or a typed trait-based approach (ValueType enum + trait accessors).

3. Improve builder ergonomics

- Consider re-exporting builder traits at higher-level modules or providing convenience helper methods on stores to reduce required imports.

4. Concurrency contract

- Add a short document or comments specifying which operations are safe concurrently and where Arc::make_mut is used for copy-on-write.

5. Add integration tests (Phase 1)

- Cover graph lifecycle, property selection, and concurrent reads.

6. Add CI steps

- Run `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --lib`, and a small integration job.

7. Performance micro-benchmarks

- Add small benches for topology traversal, property access, and graph view creation on larger synthetic graphs.

8. Documentation updates

- Add MSRV, platform support, and a short section on snapshot vs live-view semantics for `graph()` and filtered graphs.

These actions are intentionally small and concrete; we can triage and implement them incrementally. If you'd like, I can start by adding an ADR for property selection or by re-exporting builder traits to reduce friction.
