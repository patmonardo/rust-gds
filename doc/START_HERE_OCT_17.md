## 🎯 YOUR STATEMENT (By Sunday)

"I understand the Procedures system completely.

AlgorithmSpec is a clean contract proven by Sum.

ProcedureExecutor is elegant orchestration.

I know what's speculative and how PageRank will verify it.

I understand the roadmap: PageRank → Pipelines → ML.

I'm confident about the 3-week timeline.

I'm ready to code Monday with full confidence."
