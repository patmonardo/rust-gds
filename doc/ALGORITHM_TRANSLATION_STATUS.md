- You have the infrastructure to support them
- Most learnings will come from facades, not algorithms

### **Your Opportunity**
By focusing on **facades first**, you'll:
1. See the complete user API
2. Test all 31 algorithms end-to-end
3. Find performance bottlenecks early
4. Learn what algorithms work well together
5. Build the foundation for testing & optimization
