## Total Time Investment

```
Friday Night:     45 minutes (overview + confidence)
Saturday Morning: 120 minutes (core concepts + trace)
Saturday PM:      120 minutes (concrete example + patterns)
Sunday Morning:   90 minutes (speculative review)
Sunday PM:        90 minutes (preparation + readiness)
─────────────────────────────
Total:            465 minutes ≈ 7.5 hours
```

**Realistic version**: Spread across weekend at comfortable pace. Don't cram.

---

## The Learning Curve

```
Hour 1:      "This is complex"  → 🤔
Hour 2:      "I see the pattern" → ✓
Hour 3:      "This is elegant" → ✨
Hour 4:      "I could do this" → 💪
Hour 5:      "I understand why" → 🧠
Hour 6:      "I'm ready" → 🚀
Hour 7+:     Confidence and clarity → 🙏
```

You'll likely feel lost for first hour. That's normal. By hour 3, concepts click. By hour 7, you're ready.

## Key Insights to Emerge

By end of weekend, you should understand:

### Insight 1: The Contract

> "AlgorithmSpec is saying: 'I know how to parse my config, execute myself, and produce output. The executor doesn't care what I do, just that I follow this contract.'"

### Insight 2: The Orchestration

> "ProcedureExecutor is saying: 'Parse command → Validate → Load → Execute → Consume. Every algorithm follows these 5 steps. The steps are always the same; the algorithm varies.'"

### Insight 3: The Proof

> "Sum proves this works end-to-end. It's the proof that the contract + orchestration works in practice."

### Insight 4: The Scaling

> "PageRank will prove it scales to iterative computation. If PageRank works, we can do any algorithm."

### Insight 5: The Pattern

> "This is a plugin architecture. Every algorithm is a plugin to the Executor. Add new algorithms without changing executor code."

If you have these 5 insights, you're ready for Monday.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

As you read, ask:

1. **Why do we need AlgorithmSpec?**

   - Answer: So Executor can run any algorithm generically

2. **Why separate Computation and Storage?**

   - Answer: So computation logic is separate from result storage (Functor pattern)

3. **Why is Executor a state machine?**

   - Answer: So flow is clear (parse → validate → load → execute → consume) and each step is simple

4. **Why does Sum need 600 lines?**

   - Answer: Mostly boilerplate (parsing config, error handling, logging). Core logic is ~100 lines.

5. **Why does PageRank need Pregel?**
   - Answer: For message passing + iteration framework. Pregel handles the hard parts.

If you can answer these 5 questions, you understand the system.

## Red Flags to Watch For

If you're reading and see these, stop and re-read:

🚩 **"I don't understand why this trait exists"**
→ Read it again. Traits exist to define a contract between components.

🚩 **"This seems over-engineered"**
→ Probably not. Each layer has purpose. Trace how Sum uses it.

🚩 **"Why would an algorithm need this?"**
→ Read PROCEDURE_EXECUTOR_TRANSLATION.md. Java GDS needs it too.

🚩 **"This doesn't match the code I'm reading"**
→ Check file paths. Docs might reference older locations.

---

## By Sunday Evening, You're Ready If...

- [ ] You understand AlgorithmSpec contract
- [ ] You can trace the execution pipeline
- [ ] You've reviewed one speculative area
- [ ] You know what PageRank implementation needs
- [ ] You have 0 confidence blockers (questions are OK)

**If yes to all 5**: You're ready for Monday.
**If no to 2+**: Spend extra time on comprehension before starting code.

---

## Monday Morning Confidence Check

When you sit down Monday to start PageRank, ask yourself:

1. "Can I implement PageRankAlgorithmSpec?" → YES/NO
2. "Can I implement StandardPageRankComputation?" → YES/NO
3. "Can I integrate with Pregel?" → YES/NO
4. "Can I write integration tests?" → YES/NO
5. "Do I understand the contract?" → YES/NO

If all YES: Start coding immediately.
If any NO: Read the relevant docs again for 30 min, then start.

## Success Criteria for Weekend

You succeed if by Sunday evening:

✅ You understand what AlgorithmSpec is  
✅ You can explain the execution pipeline  
✅ You've traced one algorithm (Sum)  
✅ You know what speculative code needs verification  
✅ You're ready to start PageRank

If you have all 5: Take a break, you're done for the weekend. You're ready.

## Enjoy the Process

This weekend is about **understanding**, not **achieving**.

There's no deadline. No rush. Just reading and comprehension.

By taking time to truly understand the system, Monday's coding will be easy and natural.

Pace yourself. Take breaks. Ask questions.

By Sunday evening, you'll feel confident and ready.

That's the entire goal. 🙏
