## Key Questions to Answer by Sunday

By end of weekend, you should be able to answer these without looking at docs:

### About AlgorithmSpec

Q: What are the 3 main methods in AlgorithmSpec?  
A: parse_config(), execute(), consume_result()

Q: Why does execute() take a generic <G: GraphStore>?  
A: So algorithms work with any graph backend

Q: What does consume_result() do?  
A: Produces output in requested format (Stream/Stats/Write)

### About ProcedureExecutor

Q: What are the 5 execution stages?  
A: Parse ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Load ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Consume

Q: Why is this orchestration generic?  
A: So ANY AlgorithmSpec implementation can be executed

Q: What does Executor NOT need to know?  
A: What the algorithm does internally

### About Sum

Q: Why does Sum need StorageRuntime and ComputationRuntime?  
A: To separate WHERE results go (Storage) from HOW to compute (Computation)

Q: What is the Gross pole?  
A: StorageRuntime - where results accumulate

Q: What is the Subtle pole?  
A: ComputationRuntime - how to compute them

### About Speculative Areas

Q: What is uncertain about Computation trait?  
A: Whether it works for Pregel iterative computation

Q: What is uncertain about Storage trait?  
A: Whether PropertyValues can model message queues

Q: How will you verify these?  
A: Implement PageRank and see if pattern holds

### About Timeline

Q: When is PageRank due?  
A: Week 1 (Session 10)

Q: When are Pipelines due?  
A: Week 2 (Session 11)

Q: When is ML integration due?  
A: Week 3+ (Session 12+)

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Take Physical Notes

Don't just read. Write summaries in notebook.

### Tip 2: Draw Diagrams

Draw the 5-stage pipeline. Draw Storage ‚Üî Computation pattern.

### Tip 3: Trace With Your Finger

Actually follow code paths with your finger. It helps.

### Tip 4: Read Code Slowly

Spend time understanding WHY, not just WHAT.

### Tip 5: Don't Skip the Docs

Docs exist for a reason. They explain the "why".

### Tip 6: Ask Questions

Write down questions as you read. You'll answer them naturally.

### Tip 7: Take Breaks

Don't try to absorb 18,000 words in one sitting.

### Tip 8: Enjoy the Process

This is about understanding something sophisticated. Appreciate it.

## Final Checklist

Before you start reading weekend materials:

- [ ] You have the list of 8 weekend documents
- [ ] You understand the 4-hour schedule
- [ ] You know which code files to read
- [ ] You have your notes/notebook ready
- [ ] You understand the success criteria

If YES to all: You're ready to start. Good luck! üôè

## One Final Thing

You said: "I need some time to catch up. I see most of the pieces."

These documents are your "catch up" materials. They're designed to help you move from "seeing pieces" to "understanding the whole system."

By Sunday evening, you'll understand not just the pieces, but how they fit together.

That's the entire goal of this weekend.

Enjoy it! üôè
