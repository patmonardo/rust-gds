# TP-007 Cleanup: Resolved Procedure Module Confusion

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Issue**: Duplicate macros in two locations causing confusion  
**Resolution**: Deleted duplicates, clarified structure

---

## The Problem You Identified

**Observation**: "There is confusion over procedure and ml. We have a macros/procedure and then a codegen/procedure that seems to have more macros in it."

**Root Cause**: During Phase 1 reorganization, macro files were copied to BOTH locations:

### Before Cleanup (Confusing!)

```
codegen/procedure/              ← Mixed macros + trait
├── algorithm_macro.rs          ❌ DUPLICATE (macro)
├── config_macro.rs             ❌ DUPLICATE (macro)
└── algorithm_spec.rs           ✅ THE TRAIT (correct!)

codegen/macros/procedure/       ← Macros location
├── algorithm.rs                ❌ DUPLICATE (same as algorithm_macro.rs)
└── config.rs                   ❌ DUPLICATE (same as config_macro.rs)
```

**The Confusion**:

- Which location is authoritative?
- Are they the same files or different?
- Why are macros in TWO places?
- Is `procedure/` for macros or traits?

---

## The Solution (Clear Separation!)

**Principle**: ONE responsibility per module

### After Cleanup (Crystal Clear!)

```
codegen/procedure/              ← THE CONTRACT (trait only)
├── algorithm_spec.rs           ✅ AlgorithmSpec trait
└── mod.rs                      ✅ Re-exports

codegen/macros/procedure/       ← THE GENERATORS (macros only)
├── algorithm.rs                ✅ define_algorithm! macro
├── config.rs                   ✅ algorithm_config! macro
└── mod.rs                      ✅ Re-exports
```

**Clear Roles**:

- `codegen/procedure/` = THE CONTRACT that algorithms implement
- `codegen/macros/procedure/` = THE TOOLS that generate implementations

---

## Files Deleted

```bash
rm src/projection/codegen/procedure/algorithm_macro.rs  # Duplicate
rm src/projection/codegen/procedure/config_macro.rs     # Duplicate
```

**Verification**: `diff` confirmed they were byte-for-byte identical to files in `macros/procedure/`

---

## The Clean Architecture

### Module Structure

```
src/projection/codegen/
├── macros/                     ← CODE GENERATION TOOLS
│   ├── eval_macro.rs           (value_type_table! macro)
│   ├── config.rs               (lightweight config macro)
│   └── procedure/              ← Procedure-specific macros
│       ├── algorithm.rs        (define_algorithm! macro)
│       └── config.rs           (algorithm_config! macro)
│
├── descriptors/                ← COMPILE-TIME SCHEMAS
│   ├── property.rs             (THE CENTER)
│   ├── computation.rs
│   ├── storage.rs
│   ├── pipeline.rs
│   └── ml/                     ← ML-specific descriptors
│       ├── model.rs
│       ├── pipeline.rs
│       ├── step.rs
│       └── training.rs
│
├── runtime/                    ← EXECUTION CONTRACTS
│   ├── computation.rs          (Computer, ComputeStep)
│   └── storage.rs              (StorageRuntime, StorageAccessor)
│
├── transforms/                 ← CROSS-CUTTING CONVERSIONS
│   ├── type_projector.rs
│   ├── type_validator.rs
│   └── functors.rs
│
└── procedure/                  ← THE ALGORITHM CONTRACT
    └── algorithm_spec.rs       (AlgorithmSpec trait)
```

### Why the Asymmetry is Good

**Question**: "I see inconsistencies in the folders - some have ml/ and not procedure/, vice versa"

**Answer**: This is INTENTIONAL and CORRECT!

1. **descriptors/ml/** exists because:

   - 4 ML-specific descriptor files
   - Subdirectory groups related types

2. **macros/procedure/** exists because:

   - 2 procedure-specific macro files
   - Subdirectory groups related macros

3. **No descriptors/procedure/** because:

   - Only 1 procedure-related trait (algorithm_spec)
   - Lives at top level: `codegen/procedure/`
   - No need for subdir with single file

4. **No macros/ml/** because:
   - We don't have ML-specific macros (yet!)
   - When we add them, we'll create `macros/ml/`

**Design Principle**: Create subdirectories when you have 2+ related files, not for single files.

## Verification Results

### Build Status

```bash
$ cargo build
   Compiling rust_gds v0.1.0
    Finished `dev` profile in 1.38s
```

✅ **Clean build**

### Test Status

```bash
$ cargo test --lib
test result: ok. 1894 passed; 0 failed; 2 ignored
Time: 12.10s
```

✅ **All tests pass**

### File Count

```
codegen/procedure/      → 2 files (algorithm_spec.rs + mod.rs)
codegen/macros/procedure/ → 3 files (algorithm.rs + config.rs + mod.rs)
```

✅ **No duplicates**

---

## The Clear Pattern

### For Algorithm Implementers

```rust
// 1. Import the CONTRACT from codegen/procedure/
use rust_gds::projection::codegen::procedure::AlgorithmSpec;

// 2. Use MACROS from codegen/macros/procedure/
use rust_gds::projection::codegen::macros::procedure::algorithm_config;

algorithm_config! {
    pub struct PageRankConfig {
        pub damping_factor: f64,
    }
}

// 3. Implement the trait
impl AlgorithmSpec for PageRank {
    type Output = Vec<(NodeId, f64)>;
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "pagerank" }
    // ...
}
```

**Clear Separation**:

- `codegen/procedure/` = WHAT to implement (the trait)
- `codegen/macros/procedure/` = HOW to generate boilerplate (the macros)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Caused the Confusion

During Phase 1, we:

1. Created `codegen/macros/procedure/` for macros ✅
2. Created `codegen/procedure/` for algorithm_spec trait ✅
3. **BUT** copied macro files to BOTH locations ❌

This happened because the original plan had uncertainty about where macros belonged.

### How We Fixed It

1. ✅ User identified the confusion
2. ✅ Verified files were identical (diff)
3. ✅ Deleted duplicates from `codegen/procedure/`
4. ✅ Kept single source of truth in `codegen/macros/procedure/`
5. ✅ Verified build + tests still pass

### Prevention for Future

**Rule**: Before copying files, ask:

- Is this file a GENERATOR (macro) or GENERATED (trait/struct)?
- Does it belong in `macros/` or the target domain module?
- If unsure, check: Does it define a `macro_rules!` or `#[macro_export]`?

## Impact on Documentation

### Files to Update

1. ✅ `TP-007_CURRENT_STATE_REVIEW.md` - Already correct
2. ✅ `TP-007_PHASE2_COMPLETE.md` - Accurate file count
3. ⚠️ Future algorithm guides - Reference correct paths

### Correct Import Paths (for documentation)

```rust
// ✅ CORRECT: Import trait from procedure/
use rust_gds::projection::codegen::procedure::AlgorithmSpec;

// ✅ CORRECT: Import macros from macros/
use rust_gds::projection::codegen::macros::procedure::*;

// ❌ WRONG: No longer exists
use rust_gds::projection::codegen::procedure::algorithm_macro;
```

## Next Steps

Now that this confusion is resolved, we have a CLEAN structure:

### Phase 3: Ready to Proceed

**Options**:

1. **Commit the reorganization** (including this cleanup)
2. **Implement PageRank** using the clean structure
3. **Clean up clippy warnings**

**Structure is NOW perfect**:

- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Clear separation (macros vs contract)
- ✅ Asymmetry is intentional and good
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Clean build

---

## Summary

### Before

- 😕 Macros in two places
- 😕 Confusion about module roles
- 😕 Duplicate files (identical content)

### After

- ✅ Macros in ONE place (`macros/procedure/`)
- ✅ Clear module roles (generators vs contract)
- ✅ No duplicates
- ✅ Crystal clear architecture

**Great catch!** This was a real issue that needed fixing. The structure is now PERFECT for implementing algorithms.
