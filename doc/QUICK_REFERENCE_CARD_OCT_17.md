## Key Concepts (What You'll Understand)

1. **AlgorithmSpec** - Contract for algorithms
2. **5-Stage Pipeline** - Parse‚ÜíValidate‚ÜíLoad‚ÜíExecute‚ÜíConsume
3. **Storage ‚Üî Computation** - Functor pattern (Gross ‚Üî Subtle poles)
4. **Plugin Architecture** - New algorithms without changing executor
5. **What's Speculative** - Computation/Storage for Pregel (needs verification)

---

## Monday Readiness Check (6 Questions)

- [ ] Can explain AlgorithmSpec in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Can trace the execution pipeline?
- [ ] Can trace Sum execution end-to-end?
- [ ] Know what's speculative (Computation/Storage/Validation)?
- [ ] Know what PageRank implementation needs?
- [ ] Know how to integrate with Pregel?

**All YES?** ‚Üí Start PageRank Monday morning with confidence

---

## Success Criteria

### By End of Weekend

‚úÖ Understand AlgorithmSpec contract  
‚úÖ Understand execution pipeline  
‚úÖ Trace Sum execution end-to-end  
‚úÖ Know what's speculative  
‚úÖ Ready to implement PageRank

### By End of Monday

‚úÖ PageRank implements AlgorithmSpec  
‚úÖ Pregel integration works  
‚úÖ 10+ tests passing  
‚úÖ Computation/Storage patterns verified

### By End of Week

‚úÖ PageRank variants (Article, Eigenvector)  
‚úÖ Ready for Pipelines (Week 2)

---

## The Big Picture (3 Weeks)

```
Week 1:   PageRank (Session 10)
          ‚Üí Iterative algorithms proven

Week 2:   Pipelines (Session 11)
          ‚Üí Algorithm composition proven

Week 3+:  ML Integration (Session 12+)
          ‚Üí Full ML pipeline system ready
```

## Contact Points (If Stuck)

1. **Check MASTER_INDEX_OCT_17.md** - Find what you need
2. **Check WEEKEND_COMPREHENSION_RESOURCE_INDEX.md** - Cross-reference
3. **Re-read the relevant section** - Patience helps understanding
4. **Ask questions** - All questions welcome

---

## The Bottom Line

```
You've built sophisticated code.
This weekend: understand it deeply.
Monday: implement PageRank confidently.
Week: prove the patterns scale.
Month: have full ML system.

This is realistic. This is achievable.
You're in a strong position. Trust it.
