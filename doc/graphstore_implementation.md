# GraphStore Implementation - October 1, 2025

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview

Successfully implemented the **GraphStore** trait - the central orchestrator for managing and accessing graph data in Rust.

## What is GraphStore?

GraphStore is the **main facade** that ties together all the graph data components:

- **Schema**: Structure and metadata (node labels, relationship types, properties)
- **IdMap**: Node ID mapping (external → internal compact IDs)
- **Properties**: Storage for graph, node, and relationship properties
- **Topology**: Relationship connectivity structure
- **Graph**: Filtered views of the data

## Implementation

### Core Trait: `GraphStore`

Location: `src/graph_store.rs` (550+ lines)

Organized into logical sections:

1. **Database & Metadata**

   - `database_info()` - Database provenance
   - `schema()` - Graph schema
   - `creation_time()`, `modification_time()` - Temporal tracking
   - `capabilities()` - Feature flags

2. **Graph Properties**

   - Graph-level properties (not attached to nodes/relationships)
   - Add, remove, query

3. **Nodes**

   - Node counting (total, by label)
   - Label management
   - Query node labels

4. **Node Properties**

   - Property keys (all, by label, common to labels)
   - Add, remove, query node properties

5. **Relationships**

   - Relationship counting (total, by type)
   - Type management
   - Inverse index tracking

6. **Relationship Properties**

   - Property keys (all, by type, common to types)
   - Query relationship properties
   - Property type introspection

7. **Operations**
   - Delete relationships by type
   - (Graph filtering deferred for now)

### Supporting Types

**DatabaseInfo**

```rust
pub struct DatabaseInfo {
    pub name: String,
    pub location: Option<String>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

**Capabilities**

```rust
pub struct Capabilities {
    pub node_properties: bool,
    pub relationship_properties: bool,
    pub graph_properties: bool,
    pub inverse_indices: bool,
    pub dynamic_schema: bool,
}
```

**DeletionResult**

```rust
pub struct DeletionResult {
    pub relationships_deleted: usize,
    pub properties_deleted: usize,
    pub success: bool,
}
```

**GraphStoreError**

```rust
pub enum GraphStoreError {
    NodeLabelNotFound(String),
    RelationshipTypeNotFound(String),
    PropertyNotFound(String),
    InvalidOperation(String),
    SchemaError(String),
}
```

### GraphStoreAdapter

Provides a base implementation for decorators/proxies:

```rust
pub struct GraphStoreAdapter<G: GraphStore> {
    graph_store: Arc<G>,
}
```

Delegates all read operations to the underlying store.
Mutation operations return `InvalidOperation` error (requires interior mutability for shared ownership).

## Design Decisions

### 1. Trait-Based Architecture

- GraphStore is a trait, not a concrete type
- Allows multiple implementations (in-memory, disk-based, distributed)
- Adapter pattern for decoration

### 2. Arc for Property Values

- Uses `Arc<dyn Trait>` for property values
- Allows zero-copy sharing across threads
- Type-erased but still type-safe

### 3. Result Types

- All operations return `GraphStoreResult<T>`
- Clear error handling with `GraphStoreError` enum
- No panics in production code

### 4. Separation of Concerns

- GraphStore orchestrates, doesn't implement
- Delegates to specialized subsystems
- Clean API surface

### 5. TypeScript Alignment

- Mirrors `api/GraphStore.ts` interface
- Adapted for Rust idioms (Result, trait objects, ownership)
- Method names follow Rust conventions (snake_case)

## Testing

**Status**: 3/3 tests passing

Tests cover:

- DatabaseInfo creation
- Capabilities default values
- DeletionResult structure

## Dependencies Added

- **chrono** v0.4 - For temporal tracking (creation/modification times)

## What's NOT Included

### Deferred for Later:

1. **Graph filtering methods** - Require `Graph` trait definition

   ```rust
   fn get_graph(...) -> Graph;  // Many overloads in TS
   fn get_union() -> Graph;
   ```

2. **Concrete implementations** - Need actual storage backend

   - InMemoryGraphStore
   - DiskGraphStore
   - etc.

3. **Topology integration** - Need Topology trait/implementation

4. **Iterator support** - CompositeRelationshipIterator

5. **Relationship properties deep dive** - RelationshipPropertyStore details

## Usage Example (Conceptual)

```rust
use rust_property::graph_store::{GraphStore, DatabaseInfo};
use rust_property::projection::{NodeLabel, RelationshipType};

fn analyze_graph<G: GraphStore>(store: &G) {
    // Query metadata
    let db = store.database_info();
    println!("Database: {}", db.name);

    // Query structure
    let labels = store.node_labels();
    let rel_types = store.relationship_types();

    // Query properties
    let node_props = store.node_property_keys();
    let rel_props = store.relationship_property_keys();

    // Query counts
    let nodes = store.node_count();
    let rels = store.relationship_count();

    println!("Graph has {} nodes, {} relationships", nodes, rels);
}
```

## Architectural Value

### Why GraphStore Matters

1. **Unified API** - Single entry point for all graph operations
2. **Type Safety** - Rust's type system prevents misuse
3. **Composable** - Adapter pattern enables decoration
4. **Testable** - Trait allows mock implementations
5. **Flexible** - Multiple concrete implementations possible

### Integration Points

```
GraphStore (Orchestrator)
    ├── Schema (structure)
    ├── IdMap (node mapping)
    ├── Properties (values)
    │   ├── Graph properties
    │   ├── Node properties
    │   └── Relationship properties
    ├── Topology (connectivity)
    └── Graph (filtered views)
```

## Comparison to TypeScript

### TypeScript (api/GraphStore.ts)

- Interface with 40+ methods
- Heavy use of method overloading
- Dynamic typing

### Rust (src/graph_store.rs)

- Trait with 30+ methods
- No overloading (different method names)
- Static typing with trait objects
- Explicit error handling
- Ownership semantics

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete GraphStore Ecosystem

- Implement `Graph` trait
- Add graph filtering methods
- Create concrete GraphStore implementation
- Add comprehensive tests

### Option 2: Focus on Data Layer

- Implement IdMap (node ID mapping)
- Deep dive into Topology (CSR adjacency lists)
- Polars/Arrow integration for properties
- Build storage backends

### Option 3: Higher-Level APIs

- Algorithm traits (PageRank, BFS, etc.)
- Query interfaces
- Projection/loading APIs

## Recommendation

**GraphStore is complete as an API definition.**

The trait provides a clean contract. Now we can:

1. **Build concrete implementations** when needed
2. **Define supporting traits** (Graph, Topology, IdMap)
3. **Or move to algorithms** if the foundation is sufficient

The orchestrator is ready. Time to decide: **build the data layer or build the algorithms?**

---

## Key Insight

GraphStore demonstrates **Rust's strength as an orchestration language**:

- Trait-based architecture is clean and composable
- Type safety without runtime overhead
- Arc/trait objects enable flexible design
- Result types make errors explicit

**This is the kind of code Rust excels at** - high-level coordination with zero-cost abstractions.
