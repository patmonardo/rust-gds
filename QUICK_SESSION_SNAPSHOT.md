## 🔍 Key Discovery

```
Question: Do we need new Graph APIs?

We thought: Yes, build EdgeIterator, DegreeProvider, MessagePassing

We found:  ALL APIs ALREADY EXIST
           - graph.degree()                    ✅
           - graph.stream_relationships()      ✅
           - rel_cursor.target_id()            ✅
           - rel_cursor.property()             ✅
           - graph.node_count()                ✅
           - ... and more

Result: No new APIs needed for PageRank
        The system was ready all along
        We just needed clarity

## 🏗️ Architecture Revealed

```
The Three Poles (Not Theory—It's Real)

Jna (Absolute)
  │
  ├─ Prajna (Storage)
  │  └─ PageRankStorageRuntime
  │     ├─ validate_scores()      ← Validator apprehends
  │     └─ extract_messages()     ← Projector reveals
  │
  ├─ Dharma (Functor - The Walking)
  │  └─ PageRankAlgorithmSpec.execute()
  │     └─ 6-step iteration loop orchestrates poles
  │
  └─ Jnana (Computation)
     └─ PageRankComputationRuntime
        ├─ accumulate_scores()    ← Messages aggregate
        ├─ apply_damping()        ← Scores refined
        ├─ compute_residual()     ← Convergence check
        └─ normalize_scores()     ← Optional

This is mapped to the type system.
This is enforced by Rust.
This is real.

## 🎓 Five Essential API Calls

```
Everything you need to implement most algorithms:

1. Let's count nodes
   node_count: u64 = graph.node_count()

2. How many edges from this node?
   degree: usize = graph.degree(node_id)

3. Give me its outgoing edges
   stream = graph.stream_relationships(node_id, fallback_weight)

4. Where does this edge go?
   target: u64 = rel_cursor.target_id()

5. How much does it weigh?
   weight: f64 = rel_cursor.property()

That's it. That's the entire API for PageRank.
```
